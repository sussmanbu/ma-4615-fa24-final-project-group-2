    "text": "How are you continuing your exploratory data analysis? We are building on our analysis by comparing regional disparities in traffic stops and their outcomes between Rhode Island and San Francisco. For Rhode Island, we refined our insights into the racial distribution of stops, stop outcomes, and arrest likelihood over time. Our findings reveal that San Francisco exhibits district-level differences, with certain districts such as Districts D, G, and H having a stronger association with arrests. Thus, we would like to explore more on district differences and explore whether enforcement trends vary across regions. Additionally, we are incorporating analysis for both datasets to understand how arrest trends evolve over time. We are now also considering adding external demographic data, such as population breakdowns, to contextualize racial disparities better. Furthermore, geospatial visualizations can help highlight district-level variations.\nTentative thesis: Traffic stop arrest rates in Rhode Island and San Francisco are influenced by race, with Black and Hispanic facing significantly higher probabilities of arrest.\nBased on Rhode Island models, Blacks and Hispanics are about 5% more likely to be arrested compared to other races, when controlling for gender and location. This may not seem like much, however, considering the baseline chance of being arrested for Whites is about .5% (which is not significantly far from zero according to statistical convention). According to these point estimates, when controlling for other factors, Blacks and Hisapnics are more than ten times more likely to be arrested in any given traffic stop. Without controlling for other factors, we can see generally that Blacks and Hispanics are arrested about twice as frequently as other races (insert figure). Similarly in San Francisco, Blacks and Hispanics face a significantly higher probability of being arrested at a traffic stop.\nHow do you plan to polish your visualizations and tables?\nWe plan to add captions to make graphs even more clear and to add annotations to highlight key findings. We are also enhancing previous graphs and plots by adding different features such as ordering, labeling, coloring.\nFor example, this updated bar graph presents a polished visualization of arrest rates by race for San Francisco’s traffic stop data (2018–2023). It improves upon the original by introducing an intentional ordering of racial groups from the lowest to the highest arrest rate, making trends more immediately apparent. A descriptive subtitle, “San Francisco Traffic Stop Data (2018–2023),” provides critical context. Additionally, exact arrest rates are clearly displayed on each bar to improve precision and understanding. The bar with the highest arrest rate is distinctly highlighted, drawing attention to the key finding.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(readr)\n\nsf_traffic_data_clean &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset\", \"sf_traffic_dataset_clean.rds\"))\n\narrest_rates &lt;- sf_traffic_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(driver_race) %&gt;%\n  summarize(arrest_rate = mean(is_arrested, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    highlight = ifelse(arrest_rate == max(arrest_rate), \"Highest\", \"Other\"),\n    driver_race = reorder(driver_race, arrest_rate) # Reorder factor levels\n  )\n\n\nggplot(arrest_rates, aes(x = driver_race, y = arrest_rate, fill = highlight)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(arrest_rate, accuracy = 0.01)),\n            vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Arrest Rate by Race\",\n    subtitle = \"San Francisco Traffic Stop Data (2018-2023)\",\n    x = \"Race\",\n    y = \"Arrest Rate\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Highest\" = \"orange\", \"Other\" = \"lightblue\")) +\n  theme_minimal()"

Districts B, S, and T do not show a statistically significant effect on the arrest likelihood, as indicated by their higher p-values. District K shows a negative coefficient, but it is not statistically significant, indicating no strong evidence of reduced arrest likelihood.\n\nStatistical Significance:\nThe model’s p-values show that most predictors, including race (Black, Hispanic, White), gender, stop date, and certain districts (C, D, G, H, J), are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), indicating they have significant relationships with the likelihood of arrest. However, predictors such as districts B, S, T, and K are not statistically significant, suggesting no strong evidence of their association with the response variable.\n\nModel Performance:\n\nModel Performance: AIC (118023): The Akaike Information Criterion indicates the model’s fit, with a lower value suggesting a better fit. \nNull Deviance: 121691 Residual Deviance: 117985 The reduction in deviance demonstrates that the model explains more variance in the response variable compared to an intercept-only model.\n\nInterpretation:\nThis analysis suggests that race and gender remain significant predictors of arrest during traffic stops. Specifically: Black and Hispanic drivers are significantly more likely to be arrested. Male drivers have a higher likelihood of arrest compared to female drivers. The model also reveals district-level differences, with certain districts such as Districts D, G, and H having a stronger association with arrests, while others show a weaker or no significant association. Stop date trends suggest a slight decrease in arrest likelihood over time.\nBelow are some graphs to visualize the raw San Francisco data. As seen below, this data includes a much larger proportion of black and hispanic drivers compared to the RI data, and Blacks seem to be given warnings with a slightly higher proportion than other races:\n\narrest_rates &lt;- sf_traffic_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(driver_race) %&gt;%\n  summarize(arrest_rate = mean(is_arrested, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\nggplot(arrest_rates, aes(x = factor(driver_race), y = arrest_rate, fill = factor(driver_race))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Arrest Rate by Race\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Arrest Rate\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +    theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrace_stop_counts &lt;- sf_traffic_data %&gt;%\n  count(subject_race, raw_result_of_contact_description)\n\nggplot(race_stop_counts, aes(x = factor(subject_race), y = n, fill = raw_result_of_contact_description)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\") + \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Stop Results by Race\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Proportion\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + theme_minimal()"

We also described all the variables in our dataset. \nThe dataset we used can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafaadelibrahim/traffic-stops-in-rhode-islandpolicing-activities?resource=download. The dataset on traffic stops in Rhode Island is part of a larger collection by the Stanford Open Policing Project. This project aims to collect and standardize data on vehicle and pedestrian stops across 31 U.S. states, gathering over 200 million records to promote transparency and accountability in policing. The data was curated by a team of researchers and journalists at Stanford University, blending statistical analysis with data journalism.\nThe dataset had 15 variables: state, stop_date, stop_time, county_name, driver_gender, driver_race, violation_description, violation, search_conducted, search_type, stop_outcome, is_arrested, stop_duration, drugs_related_stop, and district. This data set only focused on Rhode Island so the state was irrelevant. Stop_date and stop_time stated the date and time of day that the traffic stop occurred. The county_name was an empty column. Driver_gender and driver_race detailed the gender and race of the driver who was stopped. The variable violation gave a general classification for the violation while violation_description gave a more detailed description of the reason for the traffic stop. Search_conducted (boolean), search_type, stop_outcome, is_arrested (boolean), stop_duration, drugs_related_stop (boolean) gave more details as to what occurred during the traffic stop which gives us a better idea for the severity of the traffic violation. \nIn the ”data.qmd” file, we included at the bottom some initial analysis and visualization of the distribution of traffic stops by race. You can find a bar plot and table summary showing how many stops are in the data set across each particular race. Although it may be skewed by the population proportions for each race, we can see that whites are stopped most frequently, then blacks, then hispanics, then asians."

    "text": "Data from Stanford Policing Study Reveal Racial Prejudice in Traffic Enforcement\nRacial disparity and prejudice has been existing in the world everywhere both explicitly and implicitly. Studies have shown that as much as ⅓ of traffic stops in some regions are made up of Black drivers, which highlights the importance of adapting other enforcement measures around stop or arrest rules (Lofstrom et al., 2022). Our project continues to surround the topic of interregional comparison of traffic stop arrests with a specific focus on race. This analysis demonstrates that traffic stop enforcement is influenced by race, leading to disproportionately higher arrest rates and harsher outcomes for different races.Our models for both San Francisco and Rhode Island found that Black (3.38, 2.94) and Hispanic (3.53, 2.3) individuals are more likely to be arrested, while district and driver gender also play a role, and there are several explanations for this phenomenon. Previous studies have supported our alternative hypothesis that says certain races are more likely to have a traffic stop or even get arrested. Lundman and Kaufman (2003) analyzed self-reported data from citizens and found that African American males were stopped by police at higher rates than other demographic groups. Additionally, the study highlighted that race and ethnicity influenced perceptions of the legitimacy of these traffic stops. Another study has indicated that identifying as Hispanic was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving a warning and an increased likelihood of receiving a citation (Tillyer & Engel, 2010). There are several implications of using race as a marker in traffic stops, such as undermines public trust, perpetuates social inequality, and raises ethical and legal concerns by violating principles of equal treatment under the law. This practice also reduces law enforcement efficiency, fosters racial tensions, and damages the relationship between police and communities, prompting demands for transparency and reform. In addition to the findings, this study has several limitations. It was conducted using data from two distinct and small regions of the U.S., limiting the generalizability of the results to the entire country. Moreover, the study could not adequately isolate the specific reasons for traffic stops, preventing conclusions about whether certain races are associated with higher rates of particular types of stops. Future research should aim to analyze data from a broader, nationwide sample to provide a more representative understanding of racial disparities in traffic stops. Additionally, conducting correlation analyses between the investigated variables could uncover covariations and the mixed effects of demographic factors. By guiding the reader from the well-documented, systemic issue of racial bias in policing to the tangible data from two distinct U.S. regions, this analysis reveals the human impact behind the statistics. Tracing this story—from broad patterns to localized evidence—helps contextualize the urgent need for transparency, policy reforms, and the rebuilding of trust between communities and law enforcement.\nTillyer, R., & Engel, R.

That is, there is no significant trend for arrest rates across time. On the other hand, we can look to the model summary to observe the significance of demographic information.\nThe partial and full models constructed mostly corroborate the findings of the RH model. Most notably, the factors accounting for whether the driver is Black or Hispanic have estimates of 1.08 and 0.835 respectively in the full model. The estimates have p values of 2.03x10^-203 and 1.95x10^-110 respectively, indicating extreme statistical significance. Overall, the factor of race seemed to be the most significant predictor of one’s chance of being arrested, across all models and variable selections. These give that the chance of being arrested when controlling for other factors increases by 2.94 times if the driver is black and 2.3 times if the driver is Hispanic. In other words, Black and Hispanic drivers are arrested about 50% more frequently than drivers of other races. Compared to the coefficient for whites being 0.282 with a p-value of 8x10^-17, The other coefficients are much more statistically significant in their distance from zero, these figures remain substantially more significant, underscoring the importance of race in determining arrest outcomes.\nUnder the null hypothesis, we would expect that the coefficients for all races are not significantly far from zero, however the model unequivocally shows that this is not the case. It is almost certain that across both Rhode Island and San Francisco, the chances that one has of being arrested when pulled over in a traffic stop is much greater if you are Black or Hispanic than if you are White. This conclusion provides evidence for a racial prejudice in the way in which traffic law enforcement is conducted, where certain races are arrested at an unjust frequency."

    "text": "For our study, we have sourced a dataset from the Stanford Policing Project, which supplies data on traffic stops across the country from the period of about 2005 to 2015. For this study we would like to look at areas of the country that are not a common focus of many studies, so the first part of our data will come from Rhode Island traffic stops.\nThe data we have will focus on Rhode Island traffic stops. can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafaadelibrahim/traffic-stops-in-rhode-islandpolicing-activities?resource=download\nThe full database, with traffic data for all states can be found on https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/\nThe dataset has 15 variables of focus: state, stop_date, stop_time, county_name, driver_gender, driver_race, violation_description, violation, search_conducted, search_type, stop_outcome, is_arrested, stop_duration, drugs_related_stop, and district. This data set only focused on Rhode Island so the state was irrelevant. Stop_date and stop_time stated the date and time of day that the traffic stop occurred. The county_name was an empty column, so we simply removed it for our cleaned dataset. Driver_gender and driver_race detailed the gender and race of the driver who was stopped. The variable violation gave a general classification for the violation while violation_description gave a more detailed description of the reason for the traffic stop. Search_conducted (boolean), search_type, stop_outcome, is_arrested (boolean), stop_duration, drugs_related_stop (boolean) gave more details as to what occurred during the traffic stop which gives us a better idea for the severity of the traffic violation.\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a particular traffic stop incident, and records data for the traffic stop according to the variables listed above. Our data cleaning, visualization, and initial analysis will be as follows:\nTo clean the dataset for analysis, our first step was to remove all rows that are missing values for our vairables of focus (the following is a chunk from our cleaning script]):\n\n# Removing empty rows from the dataset\ntraffic_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(driver_race) & \n           !is.na(driver_gender) & \n           !is.na(violation_raw) & \n           !is.na(violation) & \n           !is.na(search_conducted) & \n           !is.na(stop_outcome) & \n           !is.na(stop_duration) & \n           !is.na(drugs_related_stop)) %&gt;%\n  select(-state, -county_name)\n\nNext, we converted the stop_time variable, which was previously recorded as the number of seconds past 12:00am at which the stop occured, into a more readable format. To do this, we simpy apply a function which will convert seconds into the form hour:minute:second in military time (can also be found in the cleaning script])):\n\nsecs_to_time_of_day &lt;- function(seconds) {\n  hours &lt;- (seconds %/% 3600) %% 24\n  minutes &lt;- (seconds %/% 60) %% 60\n  secs &lt;- seconds %% 60\n  sprintf(\"%02d:%02d:%02d\", hours, minutes, secs)\n}\n\ntraffic_data_cleaned$stop_time &lt;- as.numeric(traffic_data_cleaned$stop_time)\n# Function to convert sec to time of day\ntraffic_data_cleaned$stop_time &lt;- sapply(traffic_data_cleaned$stop_time, secs_to_time_of_day)\n\nThe following graphs and tables show a brief visual summary of the distribution of traffic stops across race. Although we can see that the distribution may be skewed by the population proportions for each race, we can see that whites are stopped most frequently, then blacks, then hispanics, then asians.\n\nsource(\n  \"scripts/eda_traffic_data.R\",\n  echo = F\n)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\ntibble [86,536 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ stop_date         : Date[1:86536], format: \"2005-01-04\" \"2005-01-23\" ...\n $ stop_time         : chr [1:86536] \"12:55:00\" \"23:15:00\" \"04:15:00\" \"17:15:00\" ...\n $ driver_gender     : chr [1:86536] \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ driver_race       : chr [1:86536] \"White\" \"White\" \"White\" \"White\" ...\n $ violation_raw     : chr [1:86536] \"Equipment/Inspection Violation\" \"Speeding\" \"Speeding\" \"Call for Service\" ...\n $ violation         : chr [1:86536] \"Equipment\" \"Speeding\" \"Speeding\" \"Other\" ...\n $ search_conducted  : logi [1:86536] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ...\n $ search_type       : chr [1:86536] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ stop_outcome      : chr [1:86536] \"Citation\" \"Citation\" \"Citation\" \"Arrest Driver\" ...\n $ is_arrested       : logi [1:86536] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE ...\n $ stop_duration     : chr [1:86536] \"0-15 Min\" \"0-15 Min\" \"0-15 Min\" \"16-30 Min\" ...\n $ drugs_related_stop: logi [1:86536] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ...\n $ district          : chr [1:86536] \"Zone X4\" \"Zone K3\" \"Zone X4\" \"Zone X1\" ...\nNULL\n   stop_date           stop_time         driver_gender      driver_race       \n Min.   :2005-01-04   Length:86536       Length:86536       Length:86536      \n 1st Qu.:2008-01-05   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :2010-11-11   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :2010-10-05                                                           \n 3rd Qu.:2013-05-11                                                           \n Max.   :2015-12-31                                                           \n violation_raw       violation         search_conducted search_type       \n Length:86536       Length:86536       Mode :logical    Length:86536      \n Class :character   Class :character   FALSE:83229      Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   TRUE :3307       Mode  :character  \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n stop_outcome       is_arrested     stop_duration      drugs_related_stop\n Length:86536       Mode :logical   Length:86536       Mode :logical     \n Class :character   FALSE:83458     Class :character   FALSE:85674       \n Mode  :character   TRUE :3078      Mode  :character   TRUE :862         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n   district        \n Length:86536      \n Class :character  \n Mode  :character  \n                   \n                   \n                   \n\n\nFirst, we will visualize the distribution of key variables (e.g., ‘race’).

Among each race, it seems citations are the most likeley outcome, then warning, then arrest. It seems the driver is arrested more frequently for Blacks and Hispanics then other races. In addition, the frequency of traffic stops over time seems roughly constant, with a spike around 2013.\n\nprint(plot4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(plot5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(plot6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the three plots above, we can see from the first that the majority demographic for each violation type is white, and speeding also appears to be the most common violation type, then moving violaitons. For the second, we see that stop duration is the shortest for Asians and other, with Black, Hispanic, and Whites slighlty longer. Finally, we note from the thrid graph that Blacks and Hispanics are searched during a stop with a slightly higher frequency than other races (we will preform proportion testing on this difference on the Analysis page)\n\nprint(plot7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(plot8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(plot9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, based on our last set of plots, we can see the distribution of stop reasons being most concentrated at speeding, moving violations, and equipment violations. We can see across all races that stops are very infrequently drug-related, but most frequent for Blacks, then Hispanics, then Whites, and rarely ever for Asians or other races. Finally, the distribution for stop outcome in roughly equal across all races, while Blacks and Hisapnics are stopped slightly more frequently, and given warnings slightly more frequently than other races."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "#Data set 1:\nLink to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafaadelibrahim/traffic-stops-in-rhode-islandpolicing-activities?resource=download\nThe dataset of traffic stops by police officers was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project. It has 15 columns and 91741 rows. Through using this data, we hope to investigate if the driver’s race is correlated with the amount and severity of the stop. Therefore in terms of data cleaning, we might focus on the variables driver_race, search_conducted, stop_outcome, stop_duration, and is_arrested.\n#Data set 2\nLink to data set: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alzheimers-disease-and-healthy-aging-data/resource/b2443e45-68aa-4004-b97a-e62c4c28502f\nThe Alzheimer’s data set includes 284142 rows by 31 columns. The data set reports the number of people of certain age groups and races that were observed to have Alzheimer’s within a specified period of time, and records other information such as health condition and medical history. With this data set, we can study a potential racial disparity in the number of people that suffer from Alzheimer’s. The data set is sourced from the Department of Health and Human Services, and was published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The data was collected over the period of 2015 to 2022. The data can be easily loaded as it is stored simply in a CSV file. Some cleaning may be necessary as there are many variables that may be extraneous to our study, such as geographic location. In addition, there are many rows where some data entries are missing, and they will have to be cleaned out.\n#Data set 3\nLink to data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/covid19-case-surveillance-public-use-dataset\nThe COVID-19 case surveillance system database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and states. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the Nationally Notifiable Condition List and classified as “immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)” by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (Interim-20-ID-01). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification. Through comparing (hosp_yn, icu_yn, death_yn) in different racial groups, we are trying to analyze any disparities or variations. There are also many rows where some data entries are missing, and we will work to clean them out."

    "text": "Finding and implementing another dataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/san-francisco-police-stop-data-2018-2023 This dataset sourced from kaggle, contains detailed records of the police stops conducted in San Francisco over the last 5 years. It includes information such as the location, reason for stop and races that we need to make the comparative analysis.\nThe entire database containing traffic data for all regions across the nation can be found here: https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/\nTo incorporate a wider range of data for the purpose of our study, we wanted to bring in traffic stop data from other locations beyond Rhode Island. By looking at traffic data from other states across the country, we can see whether the trends observed in Rhode Island are specific to the area or not. To this end, we will incorporate a similar police stop data set, this time from San Francisco. Studying a dataset from California will allow us to compare East Coast trends against West Coast trends.\nAlthough the dataset is similar in format to the Rhode Island one (being sourced from the same Stanford Policing Project) it will require a significant amount of cleaning to be utilized for several reasons. First, the San Francisco data lists the stop duration variable as a continuous numeric value, recording the precise duration of the stop instead of discrete bins as in the Rhode Island data. In addition, the San Francisco data includes a numeric code for their categorical variables such as ‘action taken,’ ‘reason for stop’ and ‘result of stop.’ We will need to do significant translating of the row values, column names, and column types in order to make the two datasets compatible with each other.\nHere is what the raw dataset looks like:\n\nreadRDS(here::here(\"dataset\", \"sf_raw_dataset.rds\"))|&gt;\n  head(10)\n\n   raw_row_number       date      time                  location      lat\n1          869921 2014-08-01   60 secs      MASONIC AV & FELL ST 37.77300\n2          869922 2014-08-01   60 secs             GEARY&10TH AV 37.78090\n3          869923 2014-08-01  900 secs       SUTTER N OCTAVIA ST 37.78692\n4          869924 2014-08-01 1080 secs         3RD ST & DAVIDSON 37.74638\n5          869925 2014-08-01 1140 secs DIVISADERO ST. & BUSH ST. 37.78635\n6          869926 2014-08-01 1800 secs     3RD ST AND GALVEZ AVE 37.74108\n7          869927 2014-08-01 1800 secs     COLUMBUS AND BROADWAY 37.79787\n8          869928 2014-08-01 2100 secs         INGALLS & QUESADA 37.72912\n9          869929 2014-08-01 3600 secs       17TH ST & BRYANT ST 37.76432\n10         869930 2014-08-01 3600 secs  FULTON ST. & FUNSTON AV. 37.77317\n         lng district subject_age           subject_race subject_sex      type\n1  -122.4459     &lt;NA&gt;          NA asian/pacific islander      female vehicular\n2  -122.4686     &lt;NA&gt;          NA                  black        male vehicular\n3  -122.4267     &lt;NA&gt;          NA               hispanic        male vehicular\n4  -122.3920     &lt;NA&gt;          NA               hispanic        male vehicular\n5  -122.4400     &lt;NA&gt;          NA                  white        male vehicular\n6  -122.3884     &lt;NA&gt;          NA                  black        male vehicular\n7  -122.4067     &lt;NA&gt;          NA               hispanic        male vehicular\n8  -122.3840     &lt;NA&gt;          NA                  black      female vehicular\n9  -122.4104     &lt;NA&gt;          NA                  black        male vehicular\n10 -122.4713     &lt;NA&gt;          NA                  white      female vehicular\n   arrest_made citation_issued warning_issued  outcome contraband_found\n1        FALSE           FALSE           TRUE  warning               NA\n2        FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n3        FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n4        FALSE           FALSE           TRUE  warning               NA\n5        FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n6        FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n7        FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n8        FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n9        FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n10       FALSE            TRUE          FALSE citation               NA\n   search_conducted search_vehicle search_basis\n1             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n2             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n3             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n4             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n5             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n6             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n7             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n8             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n9             FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n10            FALSE          FALSE         &lt;NA&gt;\n                             reason_for_stop raw_search_vehicle_description\n1  Mechanical or Non-Moving Violation (V.C.)

    "text": "During the fourth week, we were able to further explore the data to unlock new findings. We decided to conduct a general linear model test to understand the correlation between race and arrest while controlling for stop date, gender, and district.\nModel Overview: The logistic regression model was built to investigate the correlation between several predictor variables and the likelihood of arrest during traffic stops. The predictors included driver race, stop date, driver gender, and district. The response variable (is_arrested) is binary, indicating whether an arrest occurred.\nModel Formula: logit(P(is_arrested = 1)) = β0 + β1 (driver_race) + β2 (stop_date) + β3(driver_gender) + β4(district)\n\nFindings: 1. Intercept: The negative coefficient of the intercept (-1.605) suggests that, when all other predictors are at their baseline (e.g., driver race as a reference category, date at zero, driver gender as female, etc.), the log-odds of an arrest are negative, implying a low baseline probability of arrest.\n\nDriver Race:\n\n\n\nBlack Drivers: The coefficient (1.218, p &lt; 0.001) indicates a significant positive association between being a Black driver and the likelihood of arrest. This suggests that Black drivers are more likely to be arrested compared to the baseline race category.\nHispanic Drivers: The coefficient (1.262, p &lt; 0.001) also shows a significant positive correlation, implying that Hispanic drivers face a similarly increased likelihood of arrest.\nWhite Drivers: The coefficient (0.361, p &lt; 0.05) indicates a smaller but still significant positive relationship compared to the baseline.\nOther: The negative coefficient (-0.976, p &gt; 0.05) suggests a reduced likelihood of arrest for drivers in the “Other” race category, but this finding is not statistically significant.\n\n\nStop Date:\nThe small negative coefficient (-0.000195, p &lt; 0.001) for stop_date indicates a slight but statistically significant decrease in the likelihood of arrest over time.\nDriver Gender:\nMale Drivers: The positive coefficient (0.220, p &lt; 0.001) implies that male drivers have a significantly higher chance of arrest compared to female drivers.\nDistricts:\nDistricts K2, K3, X3, and X4 have significant positive coefficients, suggesting these zones are associated with a higher likelihood of arrest. District X1 does not show a significant effect on the arrest likelihood.\n\nStatistical Significance:\nThe model’s p-values indicate that most of the predictors are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), except for the driver_race Other and districtZone X1, which do not provide strong evidence of association with the response variable.\nModel Performance:\n- AIC (25801): The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) suggests how well the model fits the data, with a lower value indicating a better fit. - Residual Deviance (25777) vs. Null Deviance (26583): The reduction in deviance demonstrates that the model explains more variance in the response variable compared to an intercept-only model.\nInterpretation:\nThe analysis suggests that race and gender are significant predictors of arrest during traffic stops, with Black and Hispanic drivers having a notably higher likelihood of arrest than other groups. The model also highlights geographical differences, with certain districts being more prone to arrests than others."
