### Data from Stanford Policing Study Reveal Racial Prejudice in Traffic Enforcement

Racial disparity and prejudice has been existing in the world everywhere both explicitly and implicitly. Studies have shown that as much as ⅓ of traffic stops in some regions are made up of Black drivers, which highlights the importance of adapting other enforcement measures around stop or arrest rules (Lofstrom et al., 2022). Our project continues to surround the topic of interregional comparison of traffic stop arrests with a specific focus on race. This analysis demonstrates that traffic stop enforcement is influenced by race, leading to disproportionately higher arrest rates and harsher outcomes for different races.Our models for both San Francisco and Rhode Island found that Black (3.38, 2.94) and Hispanic (3.53, 2.3) individuals are more likely to be arrested, while district and driver gender also play a role, and there are several explanations for this phenomenon. Previous studies have supported our alternative hypothesis that says certain races are more likely to have a traffic stop or even get arrested. Lundman and Kaufman (2003) analyzed self-reported data from citizens and found that African American males were stopped by police at higher rates than other demographic groups. Additionally, the study highlighted that race and ethnicity influenced perceptions of the legitimacy of these traffic stops. Another study has indicated that identifying as Hispanic was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving a warning and an increased likelihood of receiving a citation (Tillyer & Engel, 2010). There are several implications of using race as a marker in traffic stops, such as undermines public trust, perpetuates social inequality, and raises ethical and legal concerns by violating principles of equal treatment under the law. This practice also reduces law enforcement efficiency, fosters racial tensions, and damages the relationship between police and communities, prompting demands for transparency and reform. In addition to the findings, this study has several limitations. It was conducted using data from two distinct and small regions of the U.S., limiting the generalizability of the results to the entire country. Moreover, the study could not adequately isolate the specific reasons for traffic stops, preventing conclusions about whether certain races are associated with higher rates of particular types of stops. Future research should aim to analyze data from a broader, nationwide sample to provide a more representative understanding of racial disparities in traffic stops. Additionally, conducting correlation analyses between the investigated variables could uncover covariations and the mixed effects of demographic factors. By guiding the reader from the well-documented, systemic issue of racial bias in policing to the tangible data from two distinct U.S. regions, this analysis reveals the human impact behind the statistics. Tracing this story—from broad patterns to localized evidence—helps contextualize the urgent need for transparency, policy reforms, and the rebuilding of trust between communities and law enforcement.
